Before using Slim SEO Schema plugin, you need to add your license key in the plugin settings. Go to **Settings > Slim SEO** and click the **License** tab, then enter the license key in the input box:

Then click **Save Changes** to validate the license key. If your license key is valid and your license is active, you can start [adding schemas](/slim-seo-schema/adding-schemas/). Otherwise, you'll see a notification in the admin area to update the license key.
