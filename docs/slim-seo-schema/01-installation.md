Slim SEO Schema is a WordPress plugin. Installing it is similar to installing any other WordPress plugin:

- Go to [My Account](https://wpslimseo.com/my-account/) page and download the plugin's `.zip` file.
- In your WordPress dashboard, go to **Plugins > Add New** and click the **Upload Plugin** button.
- Select the downloaded `.zip` file to upload and click the **Install Now** button.
- Activate the plugin.

Slim SEO Schema **doesn't** require Slim SEO to work. That means you can use Slim SEO Schema separately as an individual plugin, or you can use it with Slim SEO.

Slim SEO Schema also works with any SEO plugin such as Yoast SEO, RankMath, SEO Framework, and SEOPress, ...

After installing, go to **Settings > Slim SEO** to access the plugin's settings page.

If you have Slim SEO activated, then you'll find Slim SEO Schema under the same menu, but in a different tab:

Now you need to [add license key](/slim-seo-schema/license/) to use the plugin.
