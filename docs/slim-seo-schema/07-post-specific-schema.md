Besides setting up schemas in the Settings page, you can also set up schemas for individual posts and pages.

To set up a schema for a post or page, edit it and see the schema settings in the **Schema** meta box below the post editor.

By default, the post will inherit the schema from the global settings. If you want to **override the global settings**, select a schema from the dropdown. All the properties in the schema will be displayed for the post.

The properties in the schema are the same as in the [global settings](/slim-seo-schema/adding-schemas/#properties), including [dynamic variables](/slim-seo-schema/dynamic-variables/).

When you finish editing the schema for the post, click **Save** or **Update** to save the changes. This schema will be used for the post and will override the global settings.
