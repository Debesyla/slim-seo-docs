Slim SEO works nicely with most plugins and themes. In some cases, where a plugin or a theme has special settings or SEO-related stuffs, we might need some extra work to make them run together. For that reason, we have added some integration for popular plugins and themes.

## Plugins

### Page builder plugins

- **Beaver Builder**
- **Elementor**
- **Oxygen Builder**
- **Brizy Builder**
- **Zion Builder**
- **Bricks Builder**: render the content and disable SEO tools from the builder.

### Multilingual plugins

- **WPML**
- **Polylang**

### Other plugins

- **AMP**: replace the default AMP schema with the more comprehensive schema from Slim SEO.
- **Jetpack**: disable SEO tools from Jetpack to prevent duplication.
- **LifterLMS**
- **Polylang**
- **WebStories**: replace the default schema & meta tags with the more comprehensive schema from Slim SEO.
