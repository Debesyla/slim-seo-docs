Or you can manually download and install Slim SEO if you can't install it with the method above:

- Click the **Free Download** button in the header of this website to download the plugin file (`.zip`)
- Go to your _WordPress Dashboard > Plugins > Add New_
- Click the **Upload** button
- Upload the downloaded `.zip` file
- Activate the plugin

After installing, Slim SEO works automatically even without any configuration.

The plugin also adds a settings page under _Settings > SEO_ just in case you want to insert some scripts from Google Analytics or alike. See the documentation for [Header / Footer Code](https://wpslimseo.com/docs/header-footer-code/) for details.

Now your website is auto optimized by Slim SEO. To understand what the plugin does, check out the feature list of Slim SEO on the left menu.
