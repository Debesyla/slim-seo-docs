Sometimes, you want to set specific meta title and meta description for the homepage. To do that, please follow the steps below:

## If your homepage is a static page

If you set your homepage a static page, then go to edit that static page, and you'll see the **Search Engine Optimization** meta box below the content, like other pages:

And you can enter your meta title or meta description here.

By default, the plugin will auto generate meta title and meta description (from the page excerpt and page content) if you don't enter anything.

## If your homepage displays latest posts

In this case, by default, the plugin sets the site title for meta title and site description for meta description.

If you want to change these values, please go to **Settings > SEO**, and you'll see a tab for **Homepage**, where you can enter the manual value for meta title and meta description:
