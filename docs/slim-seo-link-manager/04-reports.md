Each line in the report shows you the page title and the number of links that page has.

It's very important to know the number of links each page has because **the more links, the more important a page is**. Important pages should be your homepage or service/product/pricing pages depending on your website structure and the website silo. If you find a page that you don't want to recognize as an important page, you should remove links to it.
