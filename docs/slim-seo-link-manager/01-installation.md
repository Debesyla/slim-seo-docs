- Activate the plugin.

Slim SEO Link Manager **doesn't** require Slim SEO to work. That means you can use Slim SEO Link Manager separately as an individual plugin, or you can use it with Slim SEO.

Slim SEO Link Manager also works with any SEO plugin such as Yoast SEO, RankMath, SEO Framework, SEOPress, ...

After installing, go to **Settings > Slim SEO** to access the plugin's settings page.

If you have Slim SEO activated, then you'll find Slim SEO Link Manager under the same menu, but in a different tab:
