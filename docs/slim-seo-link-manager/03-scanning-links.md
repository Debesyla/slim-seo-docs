title: Scanning Links
---

After installing the plugin, you need to scan all posts to find links and their details. It's required to create reports in the plugin dashboard.

To scan links, clink the **Scan links now** button:

After that, the plugin will refresh and show you the current status of link scanning process:

In case you already ran the link scanning, and you want to scan again, go to the **Tools** tab and you'll find the **Scan links** button there:

The link scanning action will remove all existing link data and scans from the beginning.

When the link scanning process finishes, the status (admin notice) will disappear and you'll see reports in the plugin dashboard.
